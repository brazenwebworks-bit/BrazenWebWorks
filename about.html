            <div class="hero-content">
                <p>Brazen Web Works was founded on the belief that a digital presence is the modern cornerstone of brand
                    authority. In an era where your website is often the first—and sometimes only—impression a potential
                    customer has, we recognized a critical gap: service-based businesses were being underserved by
                    cookie-cutter templates and overpriced agencies that didn't understand their unique needs.</p>
                <p>We're not a traditional agency. We're graduate students who saw an opportunity to bring academic
                    rigor, cutting-edge research, and personalized attention to businesses that deserve better. Our
                    mission is simple: build unshakeable digital foundations that turn local service providers into
                    market authorities.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Precision</h3>
                    <p>We don't cut corners. Every line of code is written with purpose, every design decision is
                        intentional, and every feature is tested rigorously. Our academic background means we approach
                        web development like research—methodical, evidence-based, and built to last.</p>

                        expertise, and convert visitors into customers who trust your authority.</p>
